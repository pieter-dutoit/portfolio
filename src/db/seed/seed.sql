When presented with complex work, I''m skilled at identifying the tasks that need to be performed to deliver a high-caliber product that meets stakeholder requirements, and complete them on time. Furthermore, I always challenge myself to find the most creative and efficient solution to any challenges I face.\n\nMy passion for software development comes from it''s potential to develop unique and create solutions to a variety of problems. Combined with my prior work experience as a web developer, this has motivated me to pursue a related degree. Not only has the university experience provided me with a stronger foundational understanding of software development, it has challenged me to think critically about a wider range of IT concepts and developed the confidence to take on technically challenging roles. My goal is to enable myself to make valuable contributions to meaningful projects. In the future, I hope to look back and take pride in having contributed to the success of such projects.\n\nA unique strength of mine is the ability to develop a good understanding of new concepts in relatively short amount of time, which allows me to find robust solutions to complex problems. Additionally, I am skilled at finding a large variety of possible solutions to problems, comparing them, evaluating their suitability, and selecting the most appropriate solution.'
